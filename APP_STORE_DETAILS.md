## Positioning Strategy

### What Minify Radio Is
- A preset radio player for 1-3 stations
- One-tap access to your favorite stations
- Instant playback with no navigation required
- Focused listening experience

### What Minify Radio Is Not
- Not a radio discovery app
- Not a podcast player
- Not a music streaming service
- Not a social platform

### How We're Different from TuneIn
- **TuneIn**: Thousands of stations, search, discovery, podcasts, browse categories
- **Minify Radio**: Maximum 3 stations you choose once, no browsing ever

### Setting Expectations
Users should expect:
- Extremely minimal interface
- No station discovery features
- No social features
- No content recommendations
- Just their 3 chosen stations, always ready to play

This is for people who:
- Listen to the same 1-3 stations regularly
- Want zero friction between opening app and hearing audio
- Prefer simplicity over choice
- Don't want to scroll or browse
